your lot for today. <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-tour-of-india-2020-21-1243364/india-vs-england-1st-t20i-1243388/match-report>Deiva's report is up</a> and we'll have much more to come - while you wait, why not head over to Antigua and see how <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/sri-lanka-tour-of-west-indies-2020-21-1252062/west-indies-vs-sri-lanka-2nd-odi-1252070/live-cricket-score>the second ODI between West Indies and Sri Lanka is going</a> (I don't think anyone has been given out for obstructing the field yet). From myself, Deiva and Chandan, thanks for your comments, and have a good one. Bye!</p><p><b>10.25pm:</b> Time for the presentations, starting with India captain <b>Virat Kohli</b>: "We just weren't aware of what we had to do on that pitch, lack of execution on our shots and something we have to address. Accept your faults, come back with more intent, clarity of areas you want to hit. Wicket didn't allow you to hit the shots we wanted to. Shreyas showed how to use the crease and ride the bounce. Below par batting performance and England made us play. We looked to try a few things, but having said that you have to accept the conditions. If the pitch allows you to, you can be aggressive from ball one. We didn't spend enough time assessing, Shreyas did but we had lost too many wickets to get to 150-160. Part of international cricket, you have ups and down. On your day, you will end up scoring much more, sometimes it doesn't come off. Stay true to your plans but accept that the bowling team can come out and execute their plans. [Switcj from Tests?] That shouldn't be a factor, take pride in playing good white-ball cricket, won our last few T20 series. These five games before the World Cup, we have to try and few things, but we can't take anything lightly against England."</p><p>England captain <b>Eoin Morgan</b>: [Pace?] "One of Jof [Archer]'s strengths is bowling fast, among others, and certainly Mark [Wood]'s super strength. Hard to do all the time, but great entertainment and good to have him in your side. [Couldn't ask for more] No, particularly in the bowling department, the wicket was better for us than we expected. Plans were basic, hit a length and bowl straight, we didn't have to go to plan B and C very often, which is always a good sign. [Roy form?] Within the side there's huge competition, outside the squad, too. Huge support for players who score runs and does well, and when Jason does it gees the boys up. [No Test hangover] Completely different format, very distinct. In big series, like the Ashes, we've come out the back and learned from it. [Archer?] He's excellent, in the bowling unit there's a lot of competition, guys on the sidelines who could have played. We're trying to cover all departments, when they're put under pressure - today they didn't allow that to happen."</p><p>And <b>Jofra Archer</b> is named Man of the Match: "When the competition's tough you have to step up, it brings out the best in me. [Attack leader?] Probably in IPL, but with England there's world-class bowlers, so I can't take that. Rather go for dot balls in the Powerplay, and wickets are a bonus. Pressure usually helps the other bowlers as well. [Planning?] Usually, a new batter or with the bigger side to leg, you just bowl [the bouncer] because they'll have to play a very good shot to hit you for six or four."</p><p><b>10.15pm:</b> Well, well. That was a comprehensive tonking. England have parked their T20I guns on India's lawn, though it was a disciplined performance with the ball that set up victory at Motera. It's a completely different ball game from the Tests - England were twice bowled out for fewer than 130 on this ground in the pink-ball match - and they've backed up their No. 1 status in style. Never any pressure on a chase of that magnitude, but England went hard at it, as they usually do, to good effect.</p><p>Here's <b>Jason Roy</b>: "Better than a slap in the face, I'd take 49 at the start of the day. To come out and bowl and field like we did in the first game was great and will hold us in good stead. [Facing spin?] I've done a lot of practice in the nets against Rashid, working on my skills and shots. I'm 30 years old now, played a fair few games and every time you're learning. Whatever start you get off to, you've got to get your team over the line. [Buttler sedate start?] He struck the ball beautifully, interested to see what he's got for the rest of the series."</p></div></div><div class="d-flex match-comment-padder align-items-center"><div class="col-2 col-md-1 col-lg-2 match-comment-run-col"><span class="match-comment-over">15.3</span><div class="match-comment-run-container"><div class="match-comment-run match-comment-run-six"><span>6</span></div></div></div><div class="col-14 col-md-15 col-lg-14"><div style="padding-right:16px"><div class="match-comment-wrapper"><div class="match-comment-short-text"><span>Sundar to Malan<!-- -->, <!-- -->SIX runs</span></div><div class="match-comment-long-text" itemProp="articleBody"><p>That's it! <b>Malan muscles this flat over long-off to seal an eight-wicket win!</b> England have put their Test trials behind them and strolled into a 1-0 lead in the T20Is</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="match-comment-separator"></div></div><div><div class="match-comment"><div class="d-flex match-comment-padder align-items-center"><div class="col-2 col-md-1 col-lg-2 match-comment-run-col"><span class="match-comment-over">15.2</span><div class="match-comment-run-container"><div class="match-comment-run"><span>1</span></div></div></div><div class="col-14 col-md-15 col-lg-14"><div style="padding-right:16px"><div class="match-comment-wrapper"><div class="match-comment-short-text"><span>Sundar to Bairstow<!-- -->, <!-- -->1 run</span></div><div class="match-comment-long-text" itemProp="articleBody"><p>darted on the stumps and Bairstow tucks it behind square, thinks about two... but won't be coming back</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="match-comment-separator"></div></div><div><div class="match-comment"><div class="d-flex match-comment-padder align-items-center"><div class="col-2 col-md-1 col-lg-2 match-comment-run-col"><span class="match-comment-over">15.1</span><div class="match-comment-run-container"><div class="match-comment-run"><span>1</span></div></div></div><div class="col-14 col-md-15 col-lg-14"><div style="padding-right:16px"><div class="match-comment-wrapper"><div class="match-comment-short-text"><span>Sundar to Malan<!-- -->, <!-- -->1 run</span></div><div class="match-comment-long-text" itemProp="articleBody"><p>Sundar goes round the wicket, tossed up and tapped down to long-off coming forwards</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="match-comment-long-text match-comment-padder"><p>Three to win.
